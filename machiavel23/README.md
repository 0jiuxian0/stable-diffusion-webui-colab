Global_v2.0_webui_colab

A colab intended to merge all camenduru's colabs (v2.0 branch), with the possibility to download a few embeddings and vae prior of gradio launch.

ToDo:

Add subchoices for some models as well as descriptions/ðŸ¤— links

Future plans

Global_main_webui_colab - (will be the same based on main branch)

Global_v2.0_alt_webui_colab and Global_main_alt_webui_colab - (alternative version using ipywidgets and proposing more options)
